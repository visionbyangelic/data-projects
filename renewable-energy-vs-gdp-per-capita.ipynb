We will combine our correlation number (`-0.5719`), the scatter plot, the bar chart, and our \"Top 10\" lists into a single, professional conclusion.\n","\n","---\n","\n","### Project Findings: Renewable Energy vs. GDP Per Capita (2019)\n","\n","**1. The Correlation:**\n","The analysis found a **statistically significant, moderate negative correlation of -0.5719** between a country's GDP per capita and its renewable energy consumption. This suggests that, on average, as a country's wealth increases, its *percentage* of renewable energy use *decreases*.\n","\n","**2. Visual Analysis (The \"Why\"):**\n","The scatter plot showed a confusing cloud, but the **bar chart** made the story clear:\n","* **\"Low income\"** countries have a very *high* average renewable use (approx. 73%).\n","* **\"High income\"** and **\"Upper middle income\"** countries have a very *low* average renewable use (approx. 15-18%).\n","\n","This proves the negative correlation is driven by the \"Low income\" group.\n","\n","**3. The \"Who\" (The Top 10 Lists):**\n","Our `sort_values()` output explains *why* the bar chart looks this way:\n","\n","* **Finding 1 (High Renewables = Poor Nations):** The \"Top 10 Countries by Renewable Energy %\" are almost exclusively \"Low income\" nations (e.g., **Congo, Dem. Rep.**, **Somalia**, **Burundi**). This confirms our hypothesis that their high \"renewable\" percentage is not from modern solar/wind, but from traditional **biomass** (wood, charcoal, waste) used for survival.\n","\n","* **Finding 2 (Low Renewables = Rich Nations):** The \"Top 10 Richest Countries\" list shows a complex and split reality.\n","    * Many wealthy economies fit the negative trend (e.g., **Bermuda: 0.8%**, **Cayman Islands: 0.0%**), likely due to a high reliance on imported fossil fuels for a service-based economy.\n","    * However, several rich countries *defy* the trend (e.g., **Iceland: 81.7%**, **Norway: 59.8%**). This is not due to biomass, but to massive investments in modern, large-scale renewables like **geothermal** and **hydroelectric** power, driven by their unique geography.\n","\n","## Final Conclusion:\n","Our hypothesis is confirmed, but with a critical nuance. The correlation is **not** as simple as \"wealth = pollution.\"\n","\n","The moderate negative correlation is largely driven by a \"traditional energy divide\": the *poorest* nations show high renewable use (biomass), while the *middle-class and industrializing* nations show the lowest, as they are heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The *wealthiest* nations are split, with some being high-carbon and others being pioneers in modern, high-tech renewable energy."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"398b90ae","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006124,"end_time":"2025-11-23T21:09:18.104717","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-11-23T21:09:18.098593","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["publication: https://nerdyalgorithm.hashnode.dev/why-poorer-countries-use-more-renewable-energy-a-data-analysis-case-study-in-solving-messy-data"]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":8668655,"sourceId":13637729,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":8685453,"sourceId":13660862,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":8693107,"sourceId":13671762,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"},{"datasetId":8693231,"sourceId":13671965,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":31192,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":true,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.11.13"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":10.019914,"end_time":"2025-11-23T21:09:18.731362","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2025-11-23T21:09:08.711448","version":"2.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
